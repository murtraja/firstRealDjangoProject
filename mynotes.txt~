1. for ubuntu use django-admin.py startproject my_project
instead of python django-admin.py startproject my_project

2. ~/code directory is the workspace

3. project configuration directory is the directory which has the same name as the project and is inside the main project folder

4. deleting the folder automatically deletes the projects (delete from apache explicitely to avoid conflicts?)

5. use python manage.py runserver <my machine ip>:<port> so that all devices can access it who are within the network
